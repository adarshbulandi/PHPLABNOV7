/* Program Design:
1. Construct a POKEMON CLASS
2. Make 5 Pokemon Objects
3. Put them into an ARRAY: The array elements are your POKEBALLs
4. Use Random numbers to pull out 2 Pokemon
5. Battles are done with Methods and Random Number Generators for Attack Strengths
6. Use https://paiza.io/ to smith your Code.
<?php
$pokemonName = 
class Pokemon
{
    // Declare  properties
    public $PokemonName;
    public $PokemonType;
    
    // Method to Attack
    public function doPokemonAttack(){
        return (rand(1,100));
    }
}
$Pokeballs = array();
for($counter=1; $counter<6; $counter++){
    $Pikachu = new Pokemon;
    $Pikachu->PokemonName=(string)$counter;
    $Pokeballs[] = $Pikachu;
}

    $pokemon2= array_pop($Pokeballs);
